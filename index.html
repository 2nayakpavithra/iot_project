            <p>An IoT-based parking system provides real-time information on parking space availability, pricing, and beyond, 
            evolving as a helpful tool for businesses and consumers. It positively impacts the environment and traffic. It also 
            ensures efficient parking reservation and management.

        <h5 style="text-align: center;">Fig : The prototype for the IOt based car parking system</h5> 
         <p>  Here The main aim of our project is to develop and implement an IoT-based 
            car parking system. In this project, the tracking of vehicles in the 
            parking slot is done automatically using IR sensors, car allowance 
            inside the car parking area is monitored by ultrasonic sensors and 
            displayed on the Blynk app. The Parking Counting System helps monitor 
            the number of available spaces in the parking facility, providing real-time 
            updates through an IoT platform.</p>
        
        <p>The motivation behind this project stems from the need to optimize parking space utilization and alleviate the challenges posed by parking congestion. Traditional parking management systems often lack the capability to provide real-time information, leading to inefficiencies and frustration among drivers. The IoT-based car parking system aims to enhance user experience and improve overall urban mobility.</p>

        
        <p>Due to the rapid increase in vehicles, there exists a problem for parking of vehicles. Too many cars, too much traffic, and not enough parking area lead to traffic congestion and pollution, especially in metropolitan cities. This project proposes an automatic car parking system using IR sensors, addressing the challenges of manual parking systems by providing information on parking space availability. The system uses Arduino, NodeMCU ESP8266 WiFi module, and the Blynk application.</p>
